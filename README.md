# mnistclassification
This project involves using the MNIST dataset and implementing three different classification models for predicting handwritten digits. The folowing models are implemented:
1) Random Forest;
2) Feed-Forward Neural Network;
3) Convolutional Neural Network.
   
The Strategy Pattern is utilized in this project: 
- The MnistClassifierInterface is an interface;
- MnistClassifier is a context class;
- RandomForest, FeedForwardNN, and CNN are concrete strategies.
